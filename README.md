# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
The code implements facial emotion recognition using Canny edge detection and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It preprocesses the FER2013 dataset by applying Canny edge detection to enhance features, balances class distribution, and trains a CNN for multi-class emotion classification.
